This project is aimed at building models to predict frugality in consumers.
Frugality has been defined as the degree to which consumers are both restrained in acquiring and in resourcefully using economic goods 
and services to achieve long-term goals (Lavosticka et al., 1999).
Although this concept has been only neglected by marketing managers and marketing literature, a substantial number of evidence showed
how focusing on this construct may create marketing opportunities (Todd & Lowson, 2003).
In the present project, I developed an Artificial Neural Network model that is addressed to predict frugality in consumers, given a set of
features.
